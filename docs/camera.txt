A camera represents a kind of 1st person "viewport." It has these attributes:

    vec3 position;
    vec3 front;
    vec3 up;

    float pitch;
    float yaw; 
    float fov;
    float sensitivity;

A camera's position vector literally represents its current position in world 
space.

The front and up vectors are the vectors that point directly in front of and up
above the camera relative to the camera's current position and/or orientation.
The front and up vectors should never be directly modified themselves! The front
and up vectors change as a result of other variables, such as pitch and yaw.

Pitch and yaw determine where the camera is looking. Note that there is no 
roll--this is intentional, as roll does not normally get used by simple 1st 
person cameras. This camera isn't meant for a flight sim!

The FOV variable is literally just the camera's field of view in degrees.

Sensitivity is literally just how sensitive the camera is to mouse input for
the purposes of looking around. Note that this does not have anything to do with
movement speed!


A camera can be created with the create_camera() function:

    Camera create_camera(float x, float y, float z, float fov, 
        float sensitivity);


A camera can be moved by using one of its move functions:

    void move_camera_[direction](Camera *c, float distance);

The [direction] in the function name can be replaced with forward, backward,
left, or right. 

Note that the parameter "distance" here refers to the distance that the camera
should be moving each time the position gets updated. While internally, within
the camera code, we use the term "distance", outside of camera code, we use the
term "speed." Thus, expect to pass a speed value into the distance parameter; 
that is what will affect how fast the camera moves.


Looking around with the camera is done via the look_camera_around() function:

    void look_camera_around(Camera *c, float x_pos, float y_pos, float *last_x, 
        float *last_y, bool *first_mouse);

The parameters x_pos and y_pos represent the current mouse position. These
values should be obtained with something like a GLFW callback function.
The parameters last_x and last_y are the mouse's previous coordinates.

first_mouse is simply whether or not the mouse has first moved yet. It should
always be set to true.

The reason why last_x, last_y, and first_mouse are pointers is because they are
outside of the camera's state, but still a state that needs to be tracked and
constantly updated. Another solution would be to just have those values be part 
of the camera struct; since those values relate to the mouse's state and not the 
camera, though, they're not tracked as part of the camera.
